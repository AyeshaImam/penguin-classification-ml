# 🐧 Penguin Species Classification using Machine Learning

This project classifies penguin species (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap) using machine learning models trained on the Palmer Penguins dataset.

## 🔍 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Palmer Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins). It contains physical measurements of penguins including bill length, depth, flipper length, body mass, sex, and island location.

## 🧠 Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Visualizations
- Confusion Matrices
- ROC Curves
- Feature Importance (Decision Tree)
- Performance Comparison Bar Chart

## 🧪 Setup Instructions
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Run the Project
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📁 Structure
